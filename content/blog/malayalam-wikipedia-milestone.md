- Improving article quality with proper citations and references

## Top Contributors

We want to thank all our contributors, especially those who have made significant contributions over the years. Your dedication has made this milestone possible.

## What's Next?

As we celebrate this achievement, we're already looking ahead to our next goal - 100,000 articles. We're also focusing on:

- Improving article quality
- Adding more multimedia content
- Expanding coverage of underrepresented topics
- Training more contributors

Join us in this journey to make Malayalam Wikipedia even better!
