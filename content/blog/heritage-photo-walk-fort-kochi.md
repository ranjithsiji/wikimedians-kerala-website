Our recent heritage photo walk in Fort Kochi was an incredible success, with over 30 photographers participating!

## The Event

On October 28, 2025, we organized a photo walk through the historic streets of Fort Kochi. Participants documented:

- Colonial-era architecture
- Traditional fishing nets (Cheena vala)
- Historic churches and synagogues
- Street art and murals
- Local markets and daily life

## Impact

The photo walk resulted in:

- 500+ high-quality photographs uploaded to Wikimedia Commons
- Documentation of several heritage structures
- Improved Wikipedia articles with new images
- New contributors joining our community

## Participant Experiences

Participants shared their experiences:

> "This was my first contribution to Wikimedia Commons. I never realized my photographs could help preserve our heritage for future generations!" - Anjali, First-time contributor

> "The walk was well-organized and I learned so much about photography and free licensing." - Ravi, Amateur photographer

## What's Next?

Encouraged by the success, we're planning more photo walks in different parts of Kerala. Stay tuned for announcements!
